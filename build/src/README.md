# Why this folder matters

These files are the source C files generated by [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net). See [../build.sh](../build.sh) for more info on the paramers used.

Running these commands requires a development version of Python, i.e. Python compiled with `env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared"`. This can be done easily with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv):

```log
❯ env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.8.5
pyenv: /Users/chris/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5 already exists
continue with installation? (y/N) y
python-build: use openssl@1.1 from homebrew
python-build: use readline from homebrew
Downloading Python-3.8.5.tar.xz...
-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/Python-3.8.5.tar.xz
Installing Python-3.8.5...
python-build: use readline from homebrew
python-build: use zlib from xcode sdk
Installed Python-3.8.5 to /Users/chris/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5
```

These folders are zipped so that they do not generate large diffs in git.
