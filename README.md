## Notes

- Cannot use python-prompt-toolkit as it does not really support multiple input streams/sharing state between Application objects

## Todo

[x] Make window scroll
[x] Move with arrow keys
[x] Refactor to class
[x] Handle editor validation
[ ] Main app loop starts when we call start, but the listener happens on init
[x] Make backspace work
[ ] Highlight match in log
[x] Regex on `33` doesn't work?
